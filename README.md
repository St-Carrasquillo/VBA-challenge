VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

## Overview

VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data from 2018 through 2020.

## Purpose

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

- The ticker symbol
- Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The total stock volume of the stock.
- Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
- Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
